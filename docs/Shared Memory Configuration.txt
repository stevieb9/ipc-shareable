MacOS seems to be very greedy when allowing access to shared memory.

By default, it has the following:

	shmmax: 4194304	(max shared memory segment size)
	shmmin:       1	(min shared memory segment size)
	shmmni:      32	(max number of shared memory identifiers)
	shmseg:       8	(max shared memory segments per process)
	shmall:    1024	(max amount of shared memory in pages)

4MB for a segment size, with only 8 segments per process and globally, just 32.
That makes things very difficult when running unit tests for IPC::Shareable, as
there could be a couple dozen segments in use at any time, and when adding new
features, they are bound to leak segments all over the place until things are
stabilized and polished.

You can modify the kern.sysv parameters in the below file to your liking, then
put the file into a ""/Library/LaunchDaemons/SharedMemory.plist" file and reboot.
